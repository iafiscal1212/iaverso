  "text": "Johannes is a Medieval Latin form of the personal name that usually appears as \"John\" in English language contexts. It is a variant of the Greek and Classical Latin variants (\u0399\u03c9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2, Ioannes), itself derived from the Hebrew name Yehochanan, meaning \"YHWH is gracious\". The name became popular in Northern Europe, especially in Germany because of Christianity. Common German variants for Johannes are Johann, Hannes, Hans (diminutized to H\u00e4nschen or H\u00e4nsel, as known from \"Hansel and Gretel\", a fairy tale by the Grimm brothers), Jens (from Danish) and Jan (from Dutch, and found in many countries). In the Netherlands, Johannes was without interruption the most common masculine birth name until 1989. Johannes is also a popular name in South Africa, particularly among Afrikaners, due to Dutch colonial influences in the region. The English equivalent for Johannes is John.\n\n\n== In other languages ==\nChuan \u2212 Aragonese\nE\u00f3in \u2212 Irish, Scottish Gaelic\nGiovanni \u2212  Italian\nGjon, Gjin \u2212 Albanian\nHannes, Hans, Ioan, Iohannis, Jan, Janne, Jens, Jon, Jonas, Yohannes \u2212 various\nHovhannes \u2212 Armenian\nIeuan, Ifan, Ianto, anglicized as \"Evan\" \u2212 Welsh\nIvan \u2212 Slavic\nJaan, Jaanus, Juhan, Juku, Juss \u2212 Estonian\nJani \u2212 Finnish, Hungarian\nJ\u0101nis \u2212 Latvian\nJ\u00e1nos \u2212 Hungarian\nJean \u2212 French\nJoan \u2212 Catalan, Valencian, Occitan\nJ\u00f3annes \u2212 Faroese\nJo\u00e3o \u2212 Portuguese\nJohn \u2212 English\nJuan \u2212 Spanish, Manx Gaelic\nJuhani, Juha, Jukka, Hannu, Jussi, Jonne, Joni \u2212 Finnish\nJuho \u2212 Estonian, Finnish\nXo\u00e1n \u2212 Galician\nYahya \u2212 Arabic, Turkish\nZhaqiya (\u0416\u0430\u049b\u0438\u044f) \u2212 Kazakh\n\n\n== People with the given name ==\n\n\n=== Johannes or J\u00f3hannes ===\nJohannes Aavik (1880\u20131973), Estonian philologist and Fennophile\nJohannes Aigner (alpine skier) (born 2005), Austrian para alpine skier\nJ\u00f3hannes \u00c1sbj\u00f6rnsson (born 1979), Icelandic radio and TV show host\nJ\u00f3hannes Atlason (born 1944), Icelandic footballer and football manager\nJohannes Bitter (born 1982), German handball goalkeeper\nJohannes Bjelke-Petersen, former Premier of Queensland\nJohannes Brahms (1833\u20131897), German romantic composer\nJohannes Brost (1946\u20132018), Swedish actor\nJohannes Brun (disambiguation), several people\nJohannes Br\u00fcns (1903\u20131965), German politician (CDU)\nJoannes Corvus (fl. 1512\u20131544), Flemish painter\nJohannes Edfelt (1904\u20131997), Swedish writer\nJ\u00f3hannes E\u00f0valdsson (1950\u20132021), Icelandic footballer\nJ\u00f3hannes Geir J\u00f3nsson (1927\u20132003), Icelandic painter\nJohannes Geis (born 1993), German footballer\nJ\u00f3hannes Gunnarsson (1897\u20131972), Icelandic prelate of the Roman Catholic Church\nJohannes Gutenberg (1400\u20131468), German printer\nJ\u00f3hannes Har\u00f0arson (born 1976), Icelandic footballer and coach\nJohannes Hassebroek (1910\u20131977), German Nazi SS concentration camp commandant\nJohannes Heesters (1903\u20132011), Dutch actor, singer and entertainer\nJ\u00f3hannes Helgason (born 1958), Icelandic guitarist\nJohannes Helms (1828\u20131895), Danish writer and schoolmaster\nJohannes V.
