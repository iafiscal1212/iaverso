  "text": "February is the second month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars. The month has 28 days in common years and 29 in leap years, with the 29th day being called the leap day. February is the third and last month of meteorological winter in the Northern Hemisphere. In the Southern Hemisphere, February is the third and last month of meteorological summer, being the seasonal equivalent of August in the Northern Hemisphere. February is preceded by the first month of the year, January, and is succeeded by the third month of the year, March.\n\n\n== Pronunciation ==\n\"February\" can be pronounced in several different ways. The beginning of the word is commonly pronounced either as   FEB-yoo- or   FEB-roo-; many people drop the first \"r\", replacing it with , as if it were spelled \"Febuary\". This comes about by analogy with \"January\" ( ), as well as by a dissimilation effect whereby having two \"r\"s close to each other causes one to change. The ending of the word is pronounced  -\u2060err-ee in the US and  -\u2060\u0259r-ee in the UK.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Roman month Februarius was named after the Latin term februum, which means \"purification\", via the purification ritual Februa held on February 15 (full moon) in the old lunar Roman calendar. January and February were the last two months to be added to the Roman calendar, since the Romans originally considered winter a monthless period of the year. They were added by Numa Pompilius about 713 BC.  February remained the last month of the calendar year until the time of the decemvirs (c.\u2009450 BC), when it became the second month. At certain times February was truncated to 23 or 24 days, and a 27-day intercalary month, Intercalaris, was occasionally inserted immediately after February to realign the year with the seasons.\nFebruary observances in Ancient Rome included Amburbium (precise date unknown), Sementivae (February 2), Februa (February 13\u201315), Lupercalia (February 13\u201315), Parentalia (February 13\u201322), Quirinalia (February 17), Feralia (February 21), Caristia (February 22), Terminalia (February 23), Regifugium (February 24), and Agonium Martiale (February 27). These days do not correspond to the modern Gregorian calendar.\nUnder the reforms that instituted the Julian calendar, Intercalaris was abolished, leap years occurred regularly every fourth year, and in leap years February gained a 29th day. Thereafter, it remained the second month of the calendar year, meaning the order that months are displayed (January, February, March, ..., December) within a year-at-a-glance calendar. Even during the Middle Ages, when the numbered Anno Domini year began on March 25 or December 25, the second month was February whenever all twelve months were displayed in order. The Gregorian calendar reforms made slight changes to the system for determining which years were leap years, but also contained a 29-day February.\nHistorical names for February include the Old English terms Solmonath (mud month) and Kale-monath (named for cabbage) as well as Charlemagne's designation Hornung. In Finnish, the month is called helmikuu, meaning \"month of the pearl\"; when snow melts on tree branches, it forms droplets, and as these freeze again, they are like pearls of ice. In Polish and Ukrainian, respectively, the month is called luty or \u043b\u044e\u0442\u0438\u0439 (lyutiy), meaning the month of ice or hard frost. In Macedonian the month is se\u010dko (\u0441\u0435\u0447\u043a\u043e), meaning month of cutting (wood). In Czech, it is called \u00fanor, meaning month of submerging (of river ice).\nIn Slovene, February is traditionally called sve\u010dan, related to icicles or Candlemas. This name originates from si\u010dan, written as svi\u010dan in the New Carniolan Almanac from 1775 and changed to its final form by Franc Metelko in his New Almanac from 1824. The name was also spelled se\u010dan, meaning \"the month of cutting down of trees\". In 1848, a proposal was put forward in Kmetijske in rokodelske novice by the Slovene Society of Ljubljana to call this month talnik (related to ice melting), but it did not stick. The idea was proposed by a priest, Bla\u017e Poto\u010dnik. Another name of February in Slovene was vesnar, after the mythological character Vesna.\n\n\n== Patterns ==\n\nHaving only 28 days in common years, February is the only month of the year that can pass without a single full moon. Using Coordinated Universal Time as the basis for determining the date and time of a full moon, this last happened in 2018 and will next happen in 2037. The same is true regarding a new moon: again using Coordinated Universal Time as the basis, this last happened in 2014 and will next happen in 2033.\nFebruary is also the only month of the calendar that, at intervals alternating between one of six years and two of eleven years, has exactly four full 7-day weeks. In countries that start their week on a Monday, it occurs as part of a common year starting on Friday, in which February 1st is a Monday and the 28th is a Sunday; the most recent occurrence was 2021, and the next one will be 2027. In countries that start their week on a Sunday, it occurs in a common year starting on Thursday; the most recent occurrence was 2015 and the next occurrence will be 2026. The pattern is broken by a skipped leap year, but no leap year has been skipped since 1900 and no others will be skipped until 2100.\n\n\n== Astronomy ==\nFebruary meteor showers include the Alpha Centaurids (appearing in early February), the March Virginids (lasting from February 14 to April 25, peaking around March 20), the Delta Cancrids (appearing December 14 to February 14, peaking on January 17), the Omicron Centaurids (late January through February, peaking in mid-February), Theta Centaurids (January 23 \u2013 March 12, only visible in the southern hemisphere), Eta Virginids (February 24 and March 27, peaking around March 18), and Pi Virginids (February 13 and April 8, peaking between March 3 and March 9).\n\n\n== Symbols ==\n\nThe zodiac signs of February are Aquarius (until February 18) and Pisces (February 19 onward).\nIts birth flowers are the violet (Viola), the common primrose (Primula vulgaris), and the Iris. Its birthstone is the amethyst, which symbolizes piety, humility, spiritual wisdom, and sincerity.\n\n\n== Observances ==\nThis list does not necessarily imply either official status nor general
