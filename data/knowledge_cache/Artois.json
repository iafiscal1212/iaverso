  "text": "Artois ( ar-TWAH, French: [a\u0281tw\u0251]; Dutch: Artesi\u00eb; Picard: Arto\u00e9; English adjective: Artesian) is a region of northern France. Its territory covers an area of about 4,000 km2 and it has a population of about one million. Its principal cities include Arras (Dutch: Atrecht), Saint-Omer, Lens, and B\u00e9thune. It is the eponym for the term Artesian.\n\n\n== Location ==\nArtois occupies the interior of the Pas-de-Calais d\u00e9partement, the western part of which constitutes the former Boulonnais. Artois roughly corresponds to the arrondissements of Arras, B\u00e9thune, Saint Omer, and Lens, and the eastern part of the arrondissement of Montreuil. It occupies the western end of the coalfield which stretches eastward through the neighbouring Nord d\u00e9partement and across central Belgium.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nOriginally a feudal county itself, Artois was annexed by the county of Flanders. It came to France in 1180 as a dowry of a Flemish princess, Isabelle of Hainaut, and was again made a separate county in 1237 for Robert, a grandson of Isabelle. Through inheritance, Artois came under the rule of the dukes of Burgundy in 1384. At the death of the fourth duke, Charles the Bold, Artois was inherited by the Habsburgs and passed to the dynasty's Spanish line. After the religious revolts of 1566 in the Netherlands, Artois briefly entered the Dutch Revolt in 1576, participating in the Pacification of Ghent until it formed the Union of Atrecht in 1579.\nAfter the Union of Atrecht, Artois and Hainaut (Dutch: Henegouwen) reached a separate agreement with Philip II. Artois remained with the Spanish Netherlands until it was conquered by France during the Franco-Spanish War. The annexation was acknowledged during the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659, and it became a French province. Artois had already been largely French-speaking, but it was part of the Southern Netherlands until the French annexation.\nArtois experienced rapid industrial development during the second half of the 19th century, fueled by its rich coal resources. During World War I, the front line between the opposing Central Powers and Allied armies in France ran through the province, resulting in enormous physical damage. Since the second half of the 20th century, Artois has suffered along with nearby areas because of the decline of the coal industry.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nPierre-Charles Le Sueur (c. 1657 \u2013 c. 1705), born in Artois, noted explorer and trader.\nMaximilien Robespierre (1758\u20131794), French revolutionary leader, born in Arras\nCarolus Clusius (1526\u20131609), early botanist\nRobert-Fran\u00e7ois Damiens (1715\u20131757), failed regicide, born in La Thieuloye\n\n\n== See also ==\nArtesian well\nBattle of Artois (disambiguation)\nCommunaut\u00e9 d'agglom\u00e9ration de l'Artois\nCountess of Artois\nCounts of Artois\nCounty of Artois\nList of World War I memorials and cemeteries in Artois\nWeald-Artois Anticline, a ridge that connected continental Europe and Britain until 225,000 years ago\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Artois at Wikimedia Commons",
