  "text": "Hennigsdorf (German pronunciation: [\u02c8h\u025bn\u026a\u00e7s\u02ccd\u0254\u0281f] ) is a town in the district of Oberhavel, in Brandenburg, in eastern Germany. It is situated north-west of Berlin, just across the city border, which is formed mainly by the Havel river.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe town was first mentioned in 1375, when it was part of the Bohemian Crown. Afterwards it was part of the Margraviate of Brandenburg, then of the Kingdom of Prussia from 1701, and of the German Empire from 1871. During World War II, in 1944, a subcamp of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp was established, in which some 650 women, mostly Polish, were imprisoned and subjected to forced labour. In April 1945, the subcamp was dissolved and the surviving prisoners were sent on a death march to the Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp.\nAfter the war, it formed part of East Germany. The municipality shared its borders with the former West Berlin, and so during the period 1961\u20131990 it was separated from it by the Berlin Wall.\nIn 1951/2, the Havel Canal was constructed to link Hennigsdorf with Paretz, thus avoiding a passage through the reach of the River Havel, between Spandau and Potsdam, that was under the political control of West Berlin. The canal is still in use, providing a shorter route for shipping from west of Berlin to the Oder\u2013Havel Canal and Poland.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Subdivision ===\nHennigsdorf consists of 3 districts:\n\nHennigsdorf\nNieder Neuendorf (since 1923)\nStolpe-S\u00fcd (since May 1, 1998)\n\n\n=== Neighbouring places ===\nVelten\nHohen Neuendorf\nBerlin\nSch\u00f6nwalde-Glien\nOberkr\u00e4mer\n\n\n== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ==\n\nHennigsdorf is twinned with:\n\n\n== Economy ==\nLocated in Hennigsdorf  is the (Bombardier until 2021) Stadler LEW Hennigsdorf train factory and a steel smelter.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nHennigsdorf is home to Stahl Hennigsdorf Rugby, a rugby union club.
