  "text": "Sigma Hydrids are a faint, minor (Class II) meteor shower that peak around 7 December. The ZHR is 3-7 and population index is 3. They are active from November 22 to January 4.\nSigma hydrids were discovered by Richard E. McCrosky and Annette Posen.\n\n\n== 2023 ==\nLong-period comet C/2023 P1 (Nishimura) has been suggested to be the parent body of the meteor shower and came to perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) in September 2023. There is a chance of increased activity during the 2023 meteor shower if Earth passes through older meteoroid streams (such as 1591) that have had time to spread out over the comets orbit.\n\n\n== References ==\n \nP.
