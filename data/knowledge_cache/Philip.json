  "title": "Philip",
  "text": "Philip, also Phillip, is a male name derived from the Greek Φιλιππος (Philippos, lit. \"horse-loving\" or \"fond of horses\"), from a compound of φίλος (philos, \"dear\", \"loved\", \"loving\") and ἵππος (hippos, \"horse\"). Prominent Philips who popularized the name include kings of Macedonia and one of the apostles of early Christianity.\nPhilip has many alternative spellings. One derivation often used as a surname is Phillips. The original Greek spelling includes two Ps as seen in Philippides and Philippos, which is possible due to the Greek endings following the two Ps. To end a word with such a double consonant—in Greek or in English—would, however, be incorrect. It has many diminutive (or even hypocoristic) forms including Phil, Philly, Phillie, Lip, and Pip. There are also feminine forms such as Philippine and Philippa.\n\n\n== Philip in other languages ==\n\n\n== Antiquity ==\n\n\n=== Kings of Macedon ===\nPhilip I of Macedon\nPhilip II of Macedon, father of Alexander the Great\nPhilip III of Macedon, half-brother of Alexander the Great\nPhilip IV of Macedon\nPhilip V of Macedon\n\n\n=== New Testament ===\nPhilip the Apostle\nPhilip the Evangelist\n\n\n=== Others ===\nPhilippus of Croton (c. 6th century BC) Olympic victor and legendary hero\nPhilip of Opus, one of Plato's students\nPhilip of Acarnania, physician\nPhilip (son of Antipater), general of Alexander the Great\nPhilip (son of Machatas) builder of Alexandria on the Indus\nPhilip (husband of Berenice I of Egypt), son of Amyntas and first husband of Berenice I\nPhilip, brother of Lysimachus and youngest son of Agathocles of Pella\nPhilip, one of the sons of Lysimachus from his wife Arsinoe II\nPhilip (satrap), Greek satrap of Sogdiana and governor of Parthia\nPhilip I Philadelphus, ruler of the Hellenistic Seleucid kingdom\nPhilip II Philoromaeus, last ruler of the Hellenistic Seleucid kingdom\nLucius Marcius Philippus (disambiguation), multiple Roman statesmen\nPhilippides of Paiania, Greek son of Philomelos, archon of nobility, basileus 293/2 B.C.\nHerod Philip I, son of Herod the Great and husband of Herodias\nPhilip, \"the Tetrarch\", son of Herod the Great and ruler of Ituraea and Trachonitis\nPhilippus of Thessalonica, epigrammatic Greek poet and compiler of an Anthology\nPhilip the Arab, Roman emperor from 244 to 250\nPhilip of Side, Byzantine historian of the early Christian church\n\n\n== Rulers and royalty ==\n\n\n=== Papacy ===\nAntipope Philip (c. 701 – c. 800)\n\n\n=== Byzantine Empire ===\nPhilippikos Bardanes (r. 711–713), Byzantine emperor\nPhilip of Courtenay, titular Latin Emperor of Constantinople (1273–1283)\n\n\n=== King of the Belgians ===\nPhilip of Belgium\n\n\n=== King of England ===\nPhilip of England\n\n\n=== Kings of France ===\nPhilip I of France\nPhilip II of France\nPhilip III of France, \"the Bold\"\nPhilip IV of France, \"the Fair\"; also known as Philip I of Navarre\nPhilip V of France, \"the Tall\"; also known as Philip II of Navarre\nPhilip VI of France, \"the Fortunate\"\n\n\n=== Kings of Navarre ===\nPhilip I of Navarre, also known as Philip IV of France\nPhilip II of Navarre, also known as Philip V of France\nPhilip III of Navarre\n\n\n=== King of Germany ===\nPhilip of Swabia, King of Germany (r. 1198–1208) and Duke of Swabia\n\n\n=== Counts and Dukes of Savoy ===\nPhilip I, Count of Savoy (1207–1285)\nPhilip II, Duke of Savoy (1438–1497)\n\n\n=== Dukes of Burgundy ===\nPhilip I, Duke of Burgundy\nPhilip the Bold, also known as Philip II, Duke of Burgundy\nPhilip the Good, also known as Philip III, Duke of Burgundy\n\n\n=== Kings of Castile and Spain ===\nPhilip I of Castile, \"the Handsome\"; also known as Philip IV, Duke of Burgundy\nPhilip II of Spain, also known as Philip I of Portugal and Philip V of Burgundy\nPhilip III of Spain, also known as Philip II of Portugal and Philip VI of Burgundy\nPhilip IV of Spain, also known as Philip III of Portugal and Philip VII of Burgundy\nPhilip V of Spain\nPhilip VI of Spain\n\n\n=== Kings of Portugal ===\nPhilip I of Portugal, also known as Philip II of Spain and Philip V of Burgundy\nPhilip II of Portugal, also known as Philip III of Spain and Philip VI of Burgundy\nPhilip III of Portugal, also known as Philip IV of Spain and Philip VII of Burgundy\n\n\n=== Others ===\nPhilip of Sweden, a medieval king of Sweden\nPhilip of Milly, seventh Grand Master of the Knights Templar\nPhilip, Count of Flanders\nPhilip of Artois (1269–1298), heir to the countship\nPhilip of Artois, Count of Eu\nPhilip I, Prince of Taranto\nPhilip II, Prince of Taranto\nPhilip of Burgundy, Count of Auvergne\nPhilip of Poitou, Prince-Bishop of Durham\nPhilip Simonsson, claimant to the throne of Norway\nPhilip of Saint-Pol, Duke of Brabant\nPhilip, Duke of Parma\nPhilip I, Landgrave of Hesse\nPhilip II, Duke of Pomerania (1573–1618)\nPrince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh (1921–2021), consort of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms\nPhilipp, Prince of Eulenburg, Prussian diplomat\nPrince Carl Philip, prince of Sweden and Duke of Värmland\n\n\n== First name ==\nMetacomet (1638–1676), nicknamed \"King Philip\", war leader of the Wampanoag in \"King Philip's War\"\nPhiiliip (born 1980), American musician, born Philip Guichard\nPhil Anselmo (born 1968), American heavy metal vocalist and musician\nPhil Apollo, American retired professional wrestler\nPhil Barker (born 1932), American wargames designer\nPhillip Barker, Canadian-British artist and film director\nPhillip G.
