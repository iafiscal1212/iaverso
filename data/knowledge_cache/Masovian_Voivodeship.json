  "text": "Masovian Voivodeship (Polish: wojew\u00f3dztwo mazowieckie, pronounced [v\u0254j\u025b\u02c8vut\u0361stf\u0254 maz\u0254\u02c8vj\u025bt\u0361sk\u02b2\u025b] ) is a voivodeship (province) in east-central Poland, containing Poland's capital Warsaw. \nMasovian Voivodeship has an area of 35,579 square kilometres (13,737 sq mi) and had a 2019 population of 5,411,446, making it Poland's largest and most populous province. Its principal cities are Warsaw (1.783 million) in the center of the Warsaw metropolitan area, Radom (212,230) to the south, P\u0142ock (119,709) to the west, Siedlce (77,990) to the east, and Ostro\u0142\u0119ka (52,071) to the north. It borders six other provinces: Warmian-Masurian to the north, Podlaskie to the northeast, Lublin to the southeast, \u015awi\u0119tokrzyskie (Holy Cross) to the south, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a to the southwest, and Kuyavian\u2013Pomeranian to the northwest.\nThe name of the province recalls the region's traditional name, Mazovia (in Polish Mazowsze, also spelled Masovia), with which it is roughly coterminous. However, the province's southern part, including Radom, historically belonged to Lesser Poland; while \u0141om\u017ca with environs, though historically part of Mazovia, is now part of Podlaskie Voivodeship.\nMasovian Voivodeship is Poland's prime center of science, research, education, industry, and infrastructure. It has Poland's lowest unemployment rate and is a very high-income province. It is also popular with tourists due to the many historical monuments and its over 20% forested area of pine and oak. The province's Kampinos National Park is a UNESCO biosphere reserve.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the Early Middle Ages, the territory was inhabited by the Masovians, an old Polish tribe. It formed part of Poland since its establishment in the 10th century, with the then-regional capital P\u0142ock being the capital of Poland from 1079 to 1138. The Wzg\u00f3rze Tumskie (\"Cathedral Hill\") in P\u0142ock with the P\u0142ock Castle and the Catholic Cathedral, seat of one of the oldest Polish dioceses, est. in 1075, which contains the sarcophagi of a number of Polish monarchs, is listed as a Historic Monument of Poland. Later, P\u0142ock, Warsaw and Czersk were medieval ducal seats of the Piast dynasty. \nIn 1505, Radom hosted the session of the Sejm (Polish Parliament), which enacted the Nihil novi act, and in the 16th century, Warsaw hosted several sessions of the Sejm, before King Sigismund III Vasa moved the Polish capital from Krak\u00f3w to Warsaw in 1596. \nFollowing the late-18th-century Partitions of Poland, the region witnessed several uprisings against foreign rule: the Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising of 1794, the November Uprising of 1830\u20131831, and the January Uprising of 1863\u20131864. \nIn the interbellum, the region was part of reborn independent Poland. In 1920, the region was invaded by Soviet Russia, but Poland secured its freedom in the victorious Battle of Warsaw. The southern part of the current province was rapidly industrialized as part of the Central Industrial Region of Poland.\nDuring World War II, it was occupied by Germany, with the occupiers committing their genocidal policies against Poles and Jews in the region, with expulsions, massacres of civilians and prisoners of war, including at Ciepiel\u00f3w, \u015alad\u00f3w, Zakroczym, Ostr\u00f3w Mazowiecka, Palmiry, Firlej, Sk\u0142oby, Nur, Ochota, Wola, and Lipniak-Majorat. Germany operated numerous prisons, forced labour camps, the Treblinka extermination camp, in which some 700,000\u2013900,000 people were murdered, and several prisoner-of-war camps for Polish, Italian, French, Soviet, and Romanian prisoners of war.\nMasovian Province was created on 1 January 1999, under the Polish local-government reforms adopted in 1998, out of the former provinces of Warsaw, P\u0142ock, Ciechan\u00f3w, Ostro\u0142\u0119ka, Siedlce, and Radom.\n\n\n== Administrative division ==\nMasovian Voivodeship is divided into 42 counties, including five city counties and 37 land counties. These are subdivided into 314 gminas (municipalities), which include 85 urban gminas.\n\nThe counties, shown on the numbered map, are described in the table below.\n\n\n== Cities and towns ==\nThe voivodeship contains 10 cities and 78 towns. These are listed below in descending order of population (according to official figures for 2019):\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nThe Masovian voivodeship's government is headed by the province's voivode (governor) who is appointed by the Polish Prime Minister. The voivode is then assisted in performing his duties by the voivodeship's marshal, who is the appointed speaker for the voivodeship's executive and is elected by the sejmik (provincial assembly). The current voivode of Masovia is Mariusz Frankowski.\nThe Sejmik of Masovia consists of 51 members.\n\n\n=== Voivodes ===\n\n\n== Protected areas ==\n\nProtected areass include one National Park and nine Landscape parks. These are shown below.\n\nKampinos National park (a UNESCO-designated biosphere reserve)\nBolim\u00f3w Landscape park (partly in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Voivodeship)\nBrudze\u0144 Landscape Park\nBug Landscape Park\nChojn\u00f3w Landscape Park\nG\u00f3rzno-Lidzbark Landscape Park (partly in Kuyavian-Pomeranian and Warmian-Masurian Voivodeships)\nGostynin-W\u0142oc\u0142awek Landscape Park (partly in Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship)\nKozienice Landscape Park\nMasovian Landscape Park\nPodlaskie Bug Gorge Landscape Park (partly in Lublin Voivodeship)\n\n\n== Historical ==\n\n\n=== Masovian Voivodeship (1526\u20131795) ===\n\nMasovia Voivodeship, 1526\u20131795 (Polish: Wojew\u00f3dztwo Mazowieckie) was an administrative region of the Kingdom of Poland, and of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, from the 15th century until the partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (1795). Together with P\u0142ock and Rawa Voivodeships, it formed the province (prowincja) of Masovia.\n\n\n=== Masovian Voivodeship (1816\u20131837) ===\nMasovian Voivodeship was one of the voivodeships of Congress Poland. It was formed from the Warsaw Department and transformed into the Masovia Governorate.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nThree major international road routes pass through the voivodeship: Cork\u2013Berlin\u2013Pozna\u0144\u2013Warszawa\u2013Minsk\u2013Moscow\u2013Omsk (European route E30), Prague\u2013Wroc\u0142aw\u2013Warsaw\u2013Bia\u0142ystok\u2013Helsinki (E67) and Pskov\u2013Gda\u0144sk\u2013Warsaw\u2013Krak\u00f3w\u2013Budapest (E77).\nCurrently, there are various stretches of highways in the area, with the A2 highway connecting the region, and therefore the capital city, with the rest of Europe. The highway passes directly through the voivodeship from west to east, connecting it with Belarus and Germany. However, the A2 is yet to be built east of Warsaw to connect Poland with Belarus. The S7 expressway runs through Poland from the north to the south passing through Warsaw, the S8 connects Warsaw with Bia\u0142ystok, in the neighboring north-eastern province, also forming part of the Via Baltica which heads on to Lithuania, and to Wroc\u0142aw in the south-west, and the S17 being built to connect Warsaw with Lublin in the south-east and on to Ukraine.\nThe two main railway carriers operating in the region are the regional Koleje Mazowieckie and nationwide PKP Intercity. Three of ten busiest railway stations of Poland are located in the voivodeship: Warszawa Centralna, Warszawa Wschodnia, Warszawa Zachodnia.\nThe main international airport in the region is Warsaw Frederic Chopin Airport.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nMasovian Voivodeship is the wealthiest province in Poland. The gross domestic product (GDP) of the province was PLN 596 billion in 2021, accounting for 22.8% of the Polish economic output.
