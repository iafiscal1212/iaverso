  "text": "Crotonaldehyde is a chemical compound with the formula CH3CH=CHCHO. The compound is usually sold as a mixture of the E- and Z-isomers, which differ with respect to the relative position of the methyl and formyl groups.  The E-isomer is more common.  This lachrymatory liquid is moderately soluble in water and miscible in organic solvents.  As an unsaturated aldehyde, crotonaldehyde is a versatile intermediate in organic synthesis.  It occurs in a variety of foodstuffs, e.g. soybean oils.\n\n\n== Production and reactivity ==\nCrotonaldehyde is produced by the aldol condensation of acetaldehyde:\n\n2 CH3CHO \u2192 CH3CH=CHCHO + H2O\nCrotonaldehyde is a multifunctional molecule that exhibits diverse reactivity.  It is a prochiral dienophile.  It is a Michael acceptor.  Addition of methylmagnesium chloride produces 3-penten-2-ol.\n\n\n== Uses ==\n\nIt is a precursor to many fine chemicals. A prominent industrial example is the crossed aldol condensation with diethyl ketone to give trimethylcyclohexenone, this can be easily converted to trimethylhydroquinone, which is a precursor to the vitamin E.  Other derivatives include crotonic acid, 3-methoxybutanol and the food preservative Sorbic acid. Condensation with two equivalents of urea gives a pyrimidine derivative that is employed as a controlled-release fertilizer.\n\n\n== Safety ==\nCrotonaldehyde is a potent irritant even at the ppm levels. It is not very toxic, with an LD50 of 174 mg/kg (rats, oral).\n\n\n== See also ==\nCrotyl\nCrotonic acid\nCrotyl alcohol\nMethacrolein\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHazardous Substance Fact Sheet\nCDC - NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards",
